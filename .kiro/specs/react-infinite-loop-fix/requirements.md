# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The main page component (src/app/page.tsx) is experiencing a "Maximum update depth exceeded" error due to infinite re-rendering loops caused by improper useEffect dependencies. This critical issue prevents the application from loading and must be resolved immediately.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the main page to load without infinite loops, so that I can view the property listings and use the application normally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger infinite re-renders
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL load initial data exactly once
3. WHEN filters change THEN the system SHALL reload properties exactly once per filter change
4. WHEN pagination changes THEN the system SHALL reload properties exactly once per page change
5. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL NOT cause "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper useEffect dependency management, so that the component lifecycle is predictable and performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect hooks are defined THEN the system SHALL have stable function references
2. WHEN state changes THEN the system SHALL only trigger necessary re-renders
3. WHEN functions are used in useEffect dependencies THEN the system SHALL use proper memoization
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate concurrent requests
5. WHEN the component re-renders THEN the system SHALL maintain function identity where appropriate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the property filtering and pagination to work correctly, so that I can browse properties efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I change property type filter THEN the system SHALL reload properties with new filter
2. WHEN I change city filter THEN the system SHALL reload properties with new filter  
3. WHEN I change search term THEN the system SHALL reload properties with new filter
4. WHEN I change page THEN the system SHALL load properties for the new page
5. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL reload all properties
6. WHEN multiple filters change simultaneously THEN the system SHALL make only one API call
